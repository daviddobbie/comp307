This directory contains a texture classification program. 
The input file will be "input.dat" by default, if unspecified.

To build type:
make clean
make depend
make

To run, see below.

To build for an MPI environment, using the bash environment, run "bash MPI_Make.sh" (sets complier and environmental variables)
To run the file under an MPI environment run "qsub pbs-classifier" (assuming an OpenMPI setup, your milage may vary)


This classifier program is a function that creates a genertic program that is able to
identify the classification of a string of float training data, based on prior classifications
being made by the user. Using the classifier program, the user is able to test the program on
unclassified data to determine it's classification.
 
In our example, image pixel data is used to determine if a section of an image was positive or negative.
Using a training set of already classified images, a program can be generated that classifies unclassified
windows of pixel data as positive or negative. 
 
The program can be used for any data classification, as long as the CSV data file follows the following header:
 
	id, attribute01, attribute02, ..., attributeN, class
	
Where id is an id string, and class is the classification. For training files the class column must be '?'.
Data rows must be a consistent size for the program to classify it correctly.
 
The Classifier takes from 1 to 6 arguments:
 		?> classifier [-C Config.txt] [-T Training.csv] [-E Testing.csv] [-P Population.gen] 
				[-p populationMember] [-I Image.png] [-W Window Size]  
		-C - Configuration file to set evolution values. 
		-T - A training file. 
		-E - A testing file, requires Population file to be included, unless training is run at the same time.
		-P - Population file (generated by training). Can be used in conjuntion with training to seed the initial
		population.
Additional Image operators:
		-p - Population member to use from the -P Population file. (useful for multiobjective tasks)
		-I - Testing image file.
		-W - Testing image window size.
		-Th - Threshold of the image scanned

The Image testing is specific to a problem we were analysing, however is not necessary for other data sets.	
		
The config file has a number of additional options including:
	Evolution settings
	Dynamic depth limitaion / Tarpein depth limitation
	Standard selection/dynamic range selection
	Multi Objective serach based on false negatives and false positives
	
	See the config file for a more functionality.
