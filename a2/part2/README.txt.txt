To execute the symbolic regression on the dataset.

Compilation:

This is C++ code, utilising the RMITGP package. My implemetation of implementing adapts symbolic2 and allows for loading the file where the exectuable is.

To compile on the Linux ECS machines:

got to 
RMITGP/src
run 'make'

go to 
RMITGP/examples/symbolic2
run 'make'

Execution:
Run symbolic2 in RMITGP/examples/symbolic2
It will ask to load the regression file in the execution file system.
It will post parsing diagnostic information, and then not post anything until the stopping criteria are met.
